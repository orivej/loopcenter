What is loopcenter?
-------------------
loopcenter is a program that lets you easily record loops and play or overdub over them.
It is very similar to the "Loop Station" guitar pedal.
Basic usage might be:
	(1) Set the desired tempo
	(2) Record a chord progression
	(3) Overdub a melody
	(4) Play a solo over both
All key bindings are written on the GUI buttons themselves, so it should be 
pretty simple to use.
I made this program without being aware of the similar, more complete project
SooperLooper (http://essej.net/sooperlooper/), but I recommend you check that
out, too.

What is required to install loopcenter?
---------------------------------------
You'll need:
	-The JACK audio server and development files (http://jackaudio.org/)
	-The FLTK GUI toolkit (http://www.fltk.org/)

What systems does it run on?
----------------------------
I've only tested it on my i686 linux box, but (in principle) it should compile
and run fine on OS X.  In fact, without too much work, it should be able to compile
for windows, because FLTK compiles for windows, and the audio bits are done with
RtAudio (http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtaudio/), which can compile for 
Windows DirectSound and ASIO with only a change in the compilation flags.
